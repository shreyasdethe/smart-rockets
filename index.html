          The "rockets" here are objects that start out with random heading and velocity. They move for <code
            id="coding">lifespan</code> timesteps with a velocity vector defined for every timestep. The first
          generation appears to be random, but as generations go by, the rockets "learn" to go towards the goal,
          coloured red, while avoiding the walls and the obstacle, coloured grey. This is done by an algorithm called
          the 'Genetic Algorithm'.

          Each rocket is an instance of the class <code id="coding">Rocket</code> as shown.
          <pre><code id="coding">
            class Rocket{
              constructor(dna)
              update()
              evaluate()
              show()
            }
          </code></pre>
          The <code id="coding">constructor(dna)</code> initializes the instance with a fixed width and height for
          drawing, some booleans depicting its status, and a <code id="coding">dna</code> object, which is an Array of
          length <code id="coding">lifespan</code> consisting of velocity vectors. It is created from random vectors if
          <code id="coding">dna</code> is not passed while initializing the rocket.<br /><br />
          The <code id="coding">show()</code> method is called every frame of animation. It calls the <code
            id="coding">update()</code> method if the boolean <code id="coding">this.alive</code> is true. The rest of
          the method is dedicated to drawing the rocket at its current position.<br /><br />
          The <code id="coding">update()</code> method is used to update all the variables of the rocket instance such
          as the position, alive status, reached status and hit-wall status. The position vector is calculated by adding
          the velocity vector (obtained from the dna) to itself every time <code id="coding">update()</code> is called.
          The alive status is set to false everytime the rocket either hits the wall or hits the obstacle. The reached
          status is set to true when the rocket reaches the goal. It is only used for styling purposes, i,e, to make the
          rocket change colour after reaching. <br /><br />
          The <code id="coding">evaluate()</code> method is used to calculate the fitness of each rocket. It is called
          everytime the generation is reset. The fitness is calculated as an inverse map of the distance of the rocket
          from the goal. If the distance is large, the fitness will be low and if it is small, the fitness will be high.
          he fitness will be capped to 0.1 if the rocket hits the wall or the obstacle, to discourage poor performers
          from reproducing. The fitness is a variable of the <code id="coding">Rocket</code> class and is stored as
          <code id="coding">this.fitness</code>.<br />
          <hr>
          Every generation of <code id="coding">n</code> number of rockets is an instance of the <code
            id="coding">Generation</code> class, as shown.
          <pre><code id="coding">
            class Generation{
              constructor()
              update()
              selection()
              show()
            }
          </code></pre>
          The <code id="coding">constructor()</code> is called automatically everytime a new instance of the class is
          created. This method will create <code id="coding">n</code> number of rockets, create a new mating pool and
          also create a new empty Array for the new generation.<br /><br />
          The <code id="coding">update()</code> method of this class is called everytime the generation is reset, i.e.
          everytime <code id="coding">lifespan</code> is reached. This method calls the <code
            id="coding">evaluate()</code> method of every instane of the <code id="coding">Rocket</code> class it
          created, finds the maximum fitness from it and stores it as the variable <code id="coding">maxfitness</code>.
          The fitness of each rocket is then normalized by <code
            id="coding">this.fitness = this.fitness / maxfitness</code>, so every individual fitness is a value between
          0 and 1, excluding the former and including the latter.<br /><br />
          Every time this method is called, the mating pool is cleared out. The rockets from the current generation are
          pushed into the <code id="coding">this.matingpool[]</code> array according to their fitness. The number of
          times a rocket is present in the mating pool is determined by <code
            id="coding">this.rocket.fitness * mutation_rate * n</code>. This ensures that a rocket with a large value of
          fitness is present in the mating pool a large number of times and hence its probability of reproducing will
          increase.<br /><br />
          Once the mating pool is created, the <code id="coding">selection()</code> method is called. This method is
          used to perform the actual act of reproduction, in this case, DNA crossover. Two parents from the mating pool
          are chosen randomly, and a new child DNA is produced by appending the DNA from the first parent upto an
          arbitrary length, and the DNA from the second parent in the remaining child DNA. This is called crossover.
          Thus a new generation of rockets is produced from the child DNA, which has DNA from the rockets of the
          previous generation.<br /><br />
          The rockets array of the <code id="coding">Generation</code> class is now replaced with the new rockets, and
          the process is repeated several number of times.
